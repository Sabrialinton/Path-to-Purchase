## Path-to-Purchase

### Project Overview

Path to Purchase is a data analysis project conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel, focused on uncovering the key demographic and lifestyle factors that influence bicycle purchasing behavior. Using a structured dataset of over 1,000 individuals, this project explores patterns across income, age, commute distance, and more to build actionable insights for customer segmentation and marketing strategies.

Key Features:

- Full analysis and visualizations created in Excel
- Descriptive statistics and pivot-based segmentation
- Buyer profiling and trend discovery
- Interactive dashboard for insights presentation
- Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas, Dashboards)

### Key Steps in the Project

1. **Defining The Problem**: What are the key demographic and lifestyle factors that influence bike purchasing behavior?
2. **Data Cleaning**: Performed essential data cleaning to ensure consistency and readability. This included removing duplicate records, standardizing naming conventions (e.g., replacing shorthand like "M" with "Male" or "Married" using Find and Replace), and formatting income values by removing excess zeros to improve visual clarity. Additionally, created age brackets to group ages into defined ranges for simplified analysis and visualization. 
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Used PivotTables and Excel formulas to explore patterns in bike purchases across different demographic and lifestyle variables, such as gender, income, age, commute distance, and car ownership.
4. **Data Visualizations**: Created bar charts and line graphs to clearly display trends in bike purchasing behavior across age brackets, commute distances, income levels, and other key variables.
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Designed a clean and interactive Excel dashboard that allows users to filter and explore the data dynamically. The dashboard highlights key metrics and visual trends that support data-driven insights.

### Dashboard Components

Average Income by Gender
- Compares income levels between genders to observe whether higher earners are more likely to purchase bikes.

Age Bracket vs. Bike Purchase
- Visualizes which age groups are most likely to purchase bikes, using the custom age brackets created during data cleaning.

Commute Distance vs. Purchase Behavior
- Explores how commute distance affects the likelihood of purchasing a bike, comparing short vs. long commutes.

Interactive Slicers
- Includes slicers for variables such as region, marital status, and education to allow for deeper, user-driven exploration.

### Key Findings

- Higher income individuals, regardless of gender, were more likely to purchase bikes.
- Customers with very short commutes (0–1 miles) had the highest bike purchase rate.
- Those with longer commutes (5–10+ miles) were less likely to buy bikes.
- People in the 25–39 and 40–60 age brackets were most likely to purchase bikes.
