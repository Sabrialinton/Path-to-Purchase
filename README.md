This included removing duplicate records, standardizing naming conventions (e.g., replacing shorthand like "M" with "Male" or "Married" using Find and Replace), and formatting income values by removing excess zeros to improve visual clarity. Additionally, created age brackets to group ages into defined ranges for simplified analysis and visualization.
